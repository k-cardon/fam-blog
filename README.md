# A custom recipe blog built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and NextAuth

This is a private recipe blog I built to update my family's tradition of sharing recipes via a cookbook. Authenticated users (limited to my family using NextAuth) can read all the recipes, add / update / and delete their own recipes (I used Prisma as ORM for my PostgreSQL database), and add photos via AWS s3. The Next.js server components are optimized for performance, and the blog is styled with Tailwind.
